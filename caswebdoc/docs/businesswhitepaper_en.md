## Blockchain: born for finance 

Since the creation of the first blockchain – Bitcoin in 2009, there have been increasing efforts in developing blockchain-based applications across the world. Although blockchain can fit into a variety of decentralized scenarios such as sharing of information, payment, community IP creation and supply chain management, We believe that the most important use of the blockchain technology has to be in the financial industry. The blockchain technology has the potential to fundamentally change the business model in investment and financing, and it is possible to bring the financial industry into a new world of digitalization, disintermediation and global integration. 

Why do we believe so? Because the blockchain technology, which provides safety, security, authenticity, and low cost in a decentralized manner,  has overthrown some underlying assumptions of conventional financing.  

><font size=2>Modern systems we use to manage currency exchange and assets can be traced back to the Medici family of the Renaissance. By incorporating countless debts and claims in society into the single bank's general ledger, the bankers have established a strong set of the new centralized trust system. With the help of their professional intermediary service, the strangers who would not  fully trust each other can talk business. But banks have become too strong in this centralized trust system, causing that strangers are not able to do business without bank media, and as the new financial business expands and becomes more complex, other charge intermediaries will position themselves as dealers dedicated to the intermediaries - from early bonds and securities brokers to financial lawyers, and now to the third-party payment dealers and credit card companies. The growing strength of the intermediaries causes the system that should have given the people power to be pregnant with a dangerous dependency. This is the reason that led to the emergence of the Wall Street monster, and finally in 2008 the whole world was brought to the edge of disaster.</font>

In a blockchain, trust does not come from a reputable organization standing in the middle of transactions. The blockchain is built on top of an unbreakable common general ledger, which is fully public and is validated in real time by the computers that operate independently on the blockchain platform. It does not need any middleman to keep central booking, verify the identities of trading parties, or authenticize the trading securities. Instead, all the book-keeping and verification works are done by digital codes, and recognized across the whole platform simultaneously. 

## Issues of the existing blockchain platforms
Currently, the two most famous blockchain platforms are Bitcoin and Ethereum. 

### Bitcoin blockchain 

Bitcoin is the world's first blockchain-based cryptocurrency, founded by the mysterious "Satoshi Nakamoto" on January 3, 2009. Bitcoin can be created, or mined,  from any computer that adopts and recognizes Bitcoin’s design codes. Hence, it imposed an upper limit of 21 million bitcoin as a supply descipline in its design. The cryptocurrency is minable and exchangable across the world by anyone with an electronic terminal, and no third party approval or verification is needed. Up to September 1, 2017, the total market capitalization of Bitcoin has exceeded $ 70 billion. Currently, almost all major economies has recognized bitcoin as a croptocurrency from a legal perspective.  

As the first blockchain platform, Bitcoin has three major design issues, in our view: 

+ The sole purpose of Bitcoin's blockchain is for the mining of the cryptocurrency.  For other applications,  they cannot share Bitcoin’s blockchain, and have to build their own. This issue gave rise to the creation of Ethereum in 2015. 

+ Bitcoin's mining mechanism is to use CPU computing power to solve mathematical problems. However, when more powerful CPU chips were invented, it drastically changed the mining landscape. For example, ASIC professional mining chips can increase the computing power by over a million times versus common desktop CPUs. With the adoption of ASIC professional chips, super-miners emerged and ordinary desktops becomes impossible to stay in the game. Looking forward, there could be further technological innovations that escalate CPU computing power and further aggravates the mining power concentration. This is contrary to the decentralization nature of the blockchain, and in the future may undermine the whole Bitcoin community. 

+ Bitcoin does not have any coordination and community negotiation mechanisms imbedded in its design. When a material technological or application dispute emerges, it could only be resolved through a split of the platform, called “hard fork”. On August 1, 2017, Bitcoin experienced its first hard fork which created an avatar called “bitcoin cash (BCC)”. We expect the second hard fork will come soon, followed by even more splits in the future. A split is detrimental to the platform and a hard blow to Bitcoin’s reputation. If the community can only resolve via splits, it will inevitably endanger the platform and everyone participating in it.  

### Ethereum blockchain 

The concept of Ethereum was first proposed by Vitalik Buterin in 2014. Ethereum is an open-source, public, blockchain-based platform that features smart contract functionality. This is the second generation blockchain platform that allows new applications and programs to share the ethereum blockchain infrastructure, as long as they use Ethereum smart contracts to program their applications.  Ethereum also provides a cryptocurrency token called “ether (ETC)”, which can be transferred between accounts and used to compensate participant node for computations performed. In 2014, Ethereum conducted an ICO crowdfunding to issue the first batch of ether, with the remaining ether being created through mining in future years. Up to September 1, 2017, the total market capitalization of Ether was over $ 20 billion. 

Ethereum designed the smart contract and made it possible for application developers to share its blockchain infrastrucutre. This creative design greatly facilitates the proliferation of Blockchain applicatons. Since Ethereum’s inauguration in 2015, over a thousand blockchain applications have been created based on Ethereum’s smart contract. That being said, we note that Ethereum also has its own limitations: 

+ The speed for Ethereum transactions is too slow. As more and more Ethereum-based applications are launched, ether transactions grow accordingly, while its speed recedes. In theory, every 14 seconds the Ethereum platform can generate a new block, and a transaction can be confirmed once 10 new blocks are generated (thus 140 seconds throughput time for a transaction). However, in real life situation, once the transaction volume increases, confirmation takes much longer, i.e. more than 10 minutes. It is way below the standard that financial industry demands. 

+ Smart contracts are too complicated. The goal of Ethereum smart contracts is to establish a Turing-complete virtual machine, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) which can execute scripts using a global network of public nodes. Because of the complexity of its programming, its smart contract is easy to contain coding BUGs. As the Ethereum’s smart contract is open to anyone, hackers can easily analyze, identify, and utilize the BUGs in the smart contract. Once a hacker successfully attack an Ethereum application, it is impossible to revert without a “hard fork”. For example, in June 2016, The Dao, an Ethereum-based application, was attacked. Hackers discovered a coding BUG in its smart contract and the attack transferred US$50 million worth of ether to a clone account controlled by hackers. This attack directly led to a hard fork in Ethereum. The complexity of the Ethereum smart contract and its vulnerability under cyber attack make it unsuitable for financial use. 

+ Ethereum’s ERC20 smart contract supports a fast-growing ICO market. Currently, over 95% of the applications launched upon Ethereum platform have issued their own tokens through ICOs. Ethereum smart contract supports token issuance, but it does not have any mechanism to anchor the token value. These tokens are neither equity nor debt, as they are not required to be repaid or redeemed. Inevitably, more and more token issuers consider their ICOs a perfect way to raise cheap money, and thus fraudulence follows. 

+ Same as Bitcoin, Ethereum doesn't have mechanism to resolve community disputes. When problem occurs, a split is often the simpliest solution, though not usually not the optimal one. As we mentioned before, continual split of the community will eventually damage the reputation of the platform and make everyone a victim. 

## CAS.Global

### Our philosophy  

Our goal is to create a better cryptocurrency and smart contract platform that can resolve the issues that Ethereum presents. 

To do so, we created the next generation cryptocurrency, called CAS, which supports much faster digital transactions. Hence, in the smart contract, we built in a reclamation clause that allows token buyers to benefit from the issuers’ business. Hence, we create a voting mechanism to facilitate the discussion and decision making among participants. Our platform, CAS.Global, is designed for high-quality ICO issuers who honor their promises and are willing to share their growth with token buyers. 

The business plan is based on the following philosophy: 

+ Cashflow is the only source of value for long-term investing. 
    - For any securities, i.e. equity, debt, or token, its value, and especially its long-term value for investing, comes from its future cashflow generation capability. 
	
    - We note that more and more ICOs on Ethereum smart contract do not have a solid business model or execution capacity. Ethereum smart contract supports token creation, but does not support token buyers to share the issuer’s future growth. Therefore, the only reward to token buyers comes from token trading. This encourages buyers’ speculation and issuer’s misappropriation, while discourages value buyers and quality issuers. 
  
+ We encourage long-term investing based on issuer’s fundamentals. 

    - On CAS.Global platform, token issuers need to commit a routine reclamation of its tokens in circulation, supported by its operating cashflows. As the reclamation and “melting” are digitally trackable, verifiable and recorded, issuers’ routine actions will constitute a strong support to its token value, and token buyers can benefit not just from trading, but from holding tokens for the long-term. 
  
    - With the reclamation setting in CAS.Global’s smart contract, we believe this decentralized platform can help quality and responsible ICO issuers thrive while punish issuers who do not fulfill their promises. This will make CAS.Global platform a paradise for top-notch ICO issuers, and thus become a paradise for token buyers looking for long-term token value appreciation. 
  
+ Decentralized, and coordinated 

    - As a blockchain platform, CAS.Gobal does not have an owner or manager. The platform belongs to everyone in the community, and it is guaranteed by our open-source code and technological infrastructure.
  
    - That said, we realize the importance of an official communication channel for all participants. Otherwise, any future disputes may only be resolved by a split, which is a simple but suboptimal solution. 
  
    - How to create something that can effectively coordinate within the platform, while on the other hand will not undermine the decentralized nature of CAS.Global? We designed the CAS Joint Committee to fulfill the task. 

+ Fintech applications demand transaction speed, safety, security and reliability, and the CAS.Global infrastructure fulfilled these requirements.  For more details about our technological features, please refer to our “CAS.Global Technology Whitepaper”. Here, we will briefly introduce CAS technologies that are crucial to our business objectives. 

## In Cashflow We Trust

We believe that the long-term value stems from its future cashflow generation capability. It is true for equities, debt or derivatives, it is also true for tokens. However, Ethereum smart contract, as the current default choice for ICOs, does not support the token buyers to share the issuers’ future growth or cashflows. We believe this is the most important reason behind the widespread irresponsible behaviors among issuers, and speculation among token buyers. Hence, it scares away quality issuers as they do not want to burden the reputation. The reduced quality of ICOs will subsequently drive value investors out of the token market, leaving only the speculators behind. Moreover, the ICO chaos has raised regulators’ attention. In early September, 2017, Chinese regulators initiated a campaign to ban future ICO issuance, and revert those that have been offered. We also see warnings and caution statements from regulators of other major economies. 

Our CAS.Global is the next generation blockchain platform that is tailored for quality ICO issuers and investors. Through an imbedded token buyback clause, the CAS smart contract demands the ICO issuers to share part of their future growth and cashflow with token buyers. This mechanism links the issuer’s business with its token’s long-term value, and makes the token attractive to value buyers. 

### Token consumption mechanism

If a token issuer decides to use the CAS smart contract for its offering, he is required to commit a level of tokens to be routinely reclaimed and “melted” in the future. The melting rate is linked towards the issuer’s future ability to generate operating cashflows. Once a token is melted, it cannot be bought or sold in the market. This is our solution to give the token its value for long-term investment. 

Specifically: 

+ All blockchain applications developed on the CAS.Global platform must use the CAS smart contract. 

+ If the issuer decides to offer tokens (tokenization), he must commit a certain level of tokens to be reclaimed and melted, on a semi-annual basis, to the token buyers.
 
    - If the issuer fails to make the melting commitment, he is unable to create tokens by CAS smart contract. 
  
    - Once a token is reclaimed by the issuer, it will be automatically “melted”, which means that future transactions of that particular token will not be recognized by the blockchain. In other words, the melted tokens can not be bought or sold anymore. 
  
    - The issuer’s commitment is digitally recorded, tracked and verified by the program behind CAS smart contract. Nobody can modify or counterfeit the record. 
  
+ The technical design of CAS smart contract ensures that every reclaimed tokens are melted, recorded and confirmed by each node of the CAS.Global platform in a real time manner.
 
+ As every reclamation and melting actions are recorded by CAS.Global, these records constitute a credit history for a certain issuer. The credit history is open to the world, anyone with a digital terminal can check and verify these records. 

We believe that the CAS melting mechanism creates a rewarding environment for quality issuers who abide to their promises, and punish those who do not. As more and more quality issuers board the CAS platform, CAS-based tokens will be increasingly attractive to value buyers. In summary, we believe CAS has the ability to build a virtuous cycle between issuers and buyers. 

Specifically: 

+ The token buyers will find that，
    - as the value of the token relies on future reclamations from the issuer, smart token picks come from thorough research and understanding of the issuer. It is to the token buyers benefit to analyze an issuer’s business model, growth projection, cash generation ability, and the willingness to honor his promise. 
	
    - Once a token buyer makes a smart choice, the longer he holds the token, the better. It fulfills our intention to encourage long-term investing and discourage token speculation. For the top-notch token issuers, their operating cashflows grow together with their businesses. If the price for each token remained the same, the reclamation amount would surge, and the tokens in circulation would decline at a faster pace. On the other hand, the corresponding future cashflow for these tokens would only grow stronger. This may create a compelling case for exponential token value growth in the long-term future. 
	
    - It is clear that with the token melting mechanism, issuers with strong growth and operating cashflows will thrive on the CAS platform, as long as they honor their reclamation promises. On the contrary, fraudulent issuers will find CAS platform quite “costly”. We expect that problematic issuers will choose other smart contracts that are more tolerable to their misbehaviors, and stay away from the CAS platform. Eventually, token buyers will realize that the issuers on CAS smart contract are in general more investable. 
	
    - Why do we expect "bad issuers" to stay away from CAS? 
	
		- If an issuer failed to realize its reclamation promise, the CAS platform would immediately make an alert and the issuer would be uncovered. 
		
		- The CAS community will be simultaneously alerted of this discredited issuer. The issuer will immediately burden the consequences imposed by the whole CAS community. i.e. the abrupt drop of its token value, changed views from token researchers, the accusation from CAS Joint Committee, etc. 
		
		- The issuers’ default record will be kept in CAS forever. Since CAS is an open-source system, his default record will be open to everyone on this planet, unremovable and unchangable, forever. 
		
		- Considering the cost of misbehaviors, we expect the problematic issuers are more likely to choose other smart contracts that are not binding to their reclamation promises. 

+ The issuers will find that: 
    - The CAS.Global is particularly suitable for the issuers with high growth and strong cashflow. With rapid growth and strong cashflow, an issuer has the ability to reclaim more and more tokens. The remaining token in circulation will correspond to stronger future cashflows, making the token and ideal long-term investment target. Generally, the issuer holds a large portion of its ICO tokens. The upsurge of the token value is quite lucrative to abiding issuers. 
	
    - The cost of default is huge and real-time. As discussed previously, a discredited issuer will be immediately uncovered and exposed to CAS community condemnation. The token value will also suffer a sharp decline. Even though the issuer quickly initiate reclamation to settle his default status, the default history will be there forever.
	
    - Last but not least, a CAS token offering does not interfere with the issuer’s offline conventional financing activities. The token reclamation commitment has nothing to do with an issuer’s equity or credit status, and thus it is not a debt obligation, nor an equity claim. There is no equity dilution or debt repayment obligation involved in a CAS token offering. Quality issuers may realize that the offering proceeds and token value appreciation is a big bonus to issuers, apart from other means of fund raising. 

## Decentralized, and coordinated 

### CAS belongs to all participants 

The beauty of a blockchain platform stems from the following unique virtues that set apart from conventional human organization, in our view:  

+ Every node in a blockchain follows the same rules, defined by the code, and share the same ledger. In other words, there is no single node that is more important than others, or undertake more responsibilities. 

+ Therefore, a blockchain platform does not have owners, managers, or decision makers. This decentralized structure is quite different from human organizations. As long as a terminal downloads the blockchain code and join as a node, it spontenously keeps the same record, and share the same rights and responsibilities as all the other nodes. 

CAS.Global, designed as a blockchain platform, is also a strictly decentralized and  autonomous community. The CAS.Global belongs to all participants, no one, including our founding team, has any ownership or decision power in CAS.Global. CAS will evolve and prosper according to the colletive wills of the CAS community. 

### Coordination is needed 

On the other hand, what Bitcoin and Ethereum has experienced in the past years taught us a precious lesson: decentralization can also lead to repeated breakdowns of the blockchain, and eventually harm the interest of everyone on it. 

Centralization vs. autonomy is one of the most important philosophical topics over the human history. It can be traced back to ancient Greek times, when Greek philosophists such as Socrates discussed and experimented democracy against tyranny. The key question is, how to at one hand prevent the rise of the tyranny (a monopolized central organization or person), while on the other hand prevent democracy from slipping into “tyranny of the majority”? With the emergence of the decentralized blockchain, we are actually facing the same paradox that has intrigued mankind for thousands of years. 

We firmly belive that the blockchain will bring very positive impact and changes to the human society: it provides an alternative to the centralized, hierarchical organizations, which is the first time in human history. However, does decentralization strictly means no organization is allowed, even the function of the organization is to communicate, negotiate, and form consensus? We understand from previous blockchain platforms that a system without central consent will result in continual division and eventually the collapse of the community. 

Is it possible to create a mechanism that allows CAS participants to reach consensus, while still maintains the autonomy and decentralization of the CAS community? 

### CAS Joint Committee System 

We designed the CAS Joint Committee to achieve the purpose. In summary, we created a human organization in the blockchain platform to facilitate things that only human can do. We like to highlight this new design and our concepts to future blockchain platform founders, as it may help resolve the issues of continual splits, and make blockchain a long-lasting system.  

When placing a human organization in a blockchain, the most important concern, in our view, is not what it can do, but what it CAN NOT do. Only after we place the role of the CAS Joint Committee strictly on coordination, can we make sure it will not become a hassle to CAS participants, and thus obstruct the organic growth of the CAS community. 

For this purpose, we stipulated three basic laws for the CAS Joint Committee, which constitute the foundation for its establishment. In the future, any new rules, activities, or behaviors of the Committee shall not betray the following three basic laws. 

+ Evey member of the CAS Joint Committee shall be elected through the election within the CAS.Global community (Only through Election) 

+ The Committee has no power to make any decisions. (No Privilege to Decide)

+ The Committee is strictly a non-profit organization. (Not for Profit) 

We will explain the three basic laws one by one in detail. 

#### Only through Election

+ The only way to become a member of the CAS Joint Committee is through the election by all CAS.Global participants. There is no other way to join the Committee apart from the election.

+ One coin，one vote. The voting mechanism is built in CAS coins, and supported by our technology. One coin can vote once, and the voting results are public to anyone in the platform, digitally trackable and verifiable. With the blockchain technology, it is impossible to fake the results of an election. 

+ Each Committee member shall hold no less than 10,000 CAS coins during his or her term of office. Once a committee member’s holding drops below 10,000 CAS coins, the member will automatically be removed from the Committee. We would like to make suare that all the Committee members have personal stakes in CAS.Global, and are adquately involved into the community affairs already. 

+ Candidates shall declare their intention to run for the CAS Joint Committee. In doing so, they shall disclose their personal information, educational background, working experience, and personal election statement on the CAS official webiste. Candidates need to participate an election on their own wills. They need to let the Community know their interest and their qualification. 

+ For the first 12 months after CAS.Global’s inauguration, the founding team will nominate a transitional Committee to do the job. But within the 12 months, the transitional Committee needs to carry out the first CAS election, and once the first CAS Joint Committee is elected, the transitional Committee is spontenously dismissed. 

Please refer to Appendix I of the Business White Paper for more specifics on rules and procedures of CAS Joint Committee Election. 

#### No privilege to Decide

+ CAS Joint Committee can not make any important decisions for the CAS community. In particular, the Committee do not have the right to approve, or to reject any participants, activities, applications, or new developments on CAS.Global. 
 
+ For important decisions regarding CAS.Global, they can only be made via voting by all CAS coin holders, based on the rule of one coin one vote. 

+ CAS Joint Committee will participate in the decision-making process through the voting rights of the CAS coins it holds. At the inauguration, CAS Joint Committee will receive 20% of the total outstanding CAS coins. Once the CAS.Global is online, mining and trading activities will unfreeze more and more CAS coins into the market. On the other hand, we set an upper limit to the number of CAS coins that the Committee is allowed to hold (based on the basic law: Not for profit), therefore, the Committee’s voting power will gradually decline with time passes by. 

    - We believe that it is important for CAS Joint Committee to have significant voting power at the first several years so as to allow CAS community to grow along the path we desire. After the first several years when CAS community becomes more familiar with the system, the Committee’s voting power will decline sponteously, and gradually migrate to a autonomous community. 
+ When participating in the decision votes, the Committee shall choose only one side to cast its votes. 

    - That is to say, CAS Joint Committee cannot split its voting power to support contradicting viewpoints. For example, the Committee is not allowed to cast half of its votes to support a proposal, while cast another half of its votes to go against it.  
	
+ Therefore, the Committee need to reach an internal consensus before casting the Committee vote. A valid internal consensus need to satisfy the following criteria: (1) Each Committee member shall take his/her side on this topic, i.e. support, oppose, or abstain; (2) The Committee shall vote according to the majority members’ views; (3) the majority shall exceed 50% of the number of Committee members. If the number of either the supporters or the opposers does not exceed 50% of the total number of the committee members, the committee shall abstain in this vote, leaving the topic to the CAS community to decision. 

+ The responsibilities of the CAS Joint Committee include the following: 

    - Maintain CAS infrastructure, i.e. the CAS community website; 
	
    - Make proposals for the CAS community to vote; 
	
    - Promote CAS.Global to potential participants; 
	
    - Through the Committee statement on CAS website, highlight new developments, support and advocate desirable activities and behaviors, and condemn violations or irresponsible behaviors. The Committee has no right to approve or reject, but it can influence the behaviors of all participants through Committee statements.

#### Not for Profit

+ The CAS Joint Committee is forbidden to undertake any profit-seeking activities, such as investing in an entity, or cooperating with a CAS.Global participant for profit-making purposes.  

    - CAS Joint Committee and all its committee members shall stay away from any scenarios with potential conflict of interest with any CAS.Global participants.
	
+ At CAS.Global’s inauguration, CAS Joint Committee will receive 20% of total outstanding CAS coins. These CAS coins are, in nature, reserves for the Committee. These reserve CAS coins can only be used under two circumstances: 

    - Pay CAS.Global’s operating and maintenance expenses. 
	
    - Facilitate liquidity for new token offerings based on the issuers’ application. 
	
+ CAS Joint Committee can only hold CAS coin as its legitimate form of cryptocurrency asset. 

+ CAS Joint Committee is forbidden to hold more than 20% of the total outstanding CAS coins. In case it held more than that amount, the excess shall be proportionally and freely distributed to all other CAS coin holders, within three months after such an occurance. 

    - As CAS Joint Committee is not allowed to hold over 1 billion CAS coins, it ultimately remove the incentive for the Committee to step into profit-making activities that may entail a potential conflict of interest with other CAS participants. 
	
    - We expect that the Committee may generate potential earnings when facilitating liquidity for new token offerings, and the earning pool may grow together with the expansion of the CAS platform. The policy of 100% distribution of excess CAS coins makes sure that the CAS community shares the bonus of the growth. 
	
    - Also, the upper limit of the Committee CAS coins sets a boundary to the Committee voting power. As we illustrated in “No privilege to decide” section, we believe it is imperative for CAS Joint Committee to have a big voice at the beginning, so the CAS community can grow along the path we desire. However, the Committee voting power shall decline once the community is mature enoguh. The upper limit mandate makes the voting power transition possible. 
	
    - The distribution of excess Committee CAS coins will be set up and supported by our technology. Therefore, the execution of such distributions will be automatic and free from control or entanglement. 
 
In this White Paper, 

+ Appendix I illustrated the process for (1) the election the CAS Joint Committee, and (2) the voting on CAS proposals. 

+ Appendix II highlights the major functions of the future CAS community websites 

+ Appendix III is an open letter we write to the future CAS Joint Committee members. If you are interested in what CAS.Global may bring to you, we recommend you to read this letter.

## CAS technological framework

The business design of the CAS.Global cannot be achieved without the support of our technology. We published the "CAS Technical White Paper" at the mean time, with more in-depth introduction of the technology we use. In this business White Paper, we will focus on those that are critical to our business model. 

### An open-source blockchain system 

CAS is an open-source blockchain cryptocurrency system which is designed for the financial sector. We published our source codes on GitHub, and we allow third parties to customize and modify them. To do so, we created a customized interface on the Runtime Sandbox component, so that third party services can run directly in the CAS.Global clearing network. 

### Data protection mechanism of the financial system level 

We have provided privacy protection and isolation mechanism that allow third-party transaction data to be processed in a virtual network without the need to broadcast in the entire blockchain network, under the premise of ensuring that the Byzantine consensus algorithm is not compromised. 

### CAS coin

The CAS.Global ecology building is based on the technology of CAS base token (CAS coin). CAS coin is characterized by high-speed transaction and clearing, improved UTXO + balance account model, built-in voting mechanism, smart contract specification customized for the financial business, etc. 

#### High-speed, low-delay transaction performance 

For the blockchain ecology in the scenario of financial credit exchange, the transaction speed and transaction performance of the virtual base token is critical: when the circulation of Token on the platform is increasing, the transaction throughput and transaction speed of the base token directly determines the "smooth" level of the transaction. Especially for the transaction scenarios of small payment and high frequency, the requirements for performance of the virtual token will be high. 

We can proudly say that CAS coin is the world's best performing digital money system: the transaction can be confirmed within one second, with the whole network supporting 10,000 transaction peaks per second. In case of high load, the transaction performance of the CAS network will be far more superior to the bitcoin and Ether. 

#### Built-in voting mechanism 

We have built a voting mechanism of "one token for one vote" innovatively for the CAS base token. This voting mechanism is the same as the transaction request, being witnessed in the whole network through the blockchain mode. The authenticity and uniqueness of each vote will be fundamentally guaranteed by this technical design, paving the way technically for the vote of the CAS Joint Committee and the whole-network vote of major CAS events. 

The technical proposals approved by the whole-network vote through the voting mechanism will be forcibly accepted by all mining nodes, packaged nodes and trading nodes. We will encourage the disputes to be handled through the mode of voting and discussion, and we will not support the confrontation through the mode of hard forks. 

#### Providing an exchange medium for tokenization issuance and consumption using the CAS smart contract 

#### Tokenization and mining distribution mechanism

As the same with ether coin, the generation of CAS coin was achieved through a token issuance at start-up and the subsequent mining incentive mechanism. 

+ At the start-up time of the CAS.Global, a token issuance would be conducted, with a total issuance of 2 billion of CAS coin, of which 1 billion token would be handed over to the CAS Joint Committee gratis as "reserve token" and managed in strict accordance with the Committee's Basic Law; the other 1 billion of token was sold to the first CAS Community participants through targeted and open sales. 

+ After the issuance of CAS token, the "thawing" of the new CAS coin, could only be achieved through the mechanism of mining and distribution incentives. Minors could obtain CAS coin through traditional computing power competition, as well as the distribution and packing of transactions. For the distribution and packaging nodes of the transaction, the miners no longer put the resources into the computing power competition lack of real value, but into the faster processing speed, better broadband, IDC room construction, more stable 7x24 hours running, to distribute and package more nodes more rapidly, and continue to improve the whole-network processing speed of the CAS network. 

### CAS smart contract designed for the capital market 

The low-level technology design of the CAS Smart Contract allows the CAS system to conduct real-time tracking, confirmation and bookkeeping for the token consumption and destruction through pure program setting.

+ For issuers that use CAS smart contract, in order to effectively support and record its token issuance and consumption behaviors on the CAS.Global platform in the technical bookkeeping, all the tokenization based on CAS smart contract must be done through CAS coin. 

+ The CAS smart contract can make distinctions of the tokenization issuer and the exchanges between the CAS coin and the token it issues. 

+ The token consumed will be automatically "dyed" by the system, which is unable to enter the market for circulation again. 

+ CAS smart contract will conduct the automatic bookkeeping of the "dyed" token, to make sure whether the issuers finish the consumption clause promised in the smart contract. 

On the other hand, compared with the smart contract of Ethereum, the CAS smart contract merely targets at the scenes of the financial credit exchange, so the programming requirements are very simple. Theoretically, the issuer will not have the hacker attack led by the loopholes in programming. In this sense, both the safety and convenience of CAS smart contract have a qualitative leap compared with the smart contract of Ethereum. 

## Appendix I: CAS Voting 

### Election of CAS Joint Committee

+ Eligible candidates for CAS Joint Committee members shall satisfy the following two premises: 

    - The candidate shall hold no less than 10,000 CAS coins and promise that once elected, he or she shall keep holding no less than 10,000 CAS coins during his tenure. 
	
    - The candidate shall declare his intention to run for the Committee office on CAS community website. In doing so, the candidate shall disclose his personal information, educational background, working experience, and personal election statement on the CAS official website. 
	
+ All CAS coin holders are eligible to vote. Every CAS coin contains one vote to a candidate. 

+ Anyone holding multiple CAS coins may split their votes to vote for different candidates. This rule also applies to the CAS Joint Committee’s voting rights. 

+ A candidate is elected as a member of CAS Joint Committee, as long as the candidate is entrusted with no less than 200 million votes. There is no upper limit to the total number of committee members, but there is a lower limit. There shall be at least five Committee members on board so as to balance the power among Committee members.
 
+ Under the circumstances that less than five candidates receive over 200 million votes, the five candidates with the highest number of votes will be elected as CAS Joint Committee members. 

+ CAS Joint Committee election takes place every year. 

+ For the first 12 months after CAS.Global’s inauguration, the founding team will nominate a transitional Committee to do the job. But within the 12 months, the transitional Committee needs to carry out the first CAS election, and once the first CAS Joint Committee is elected, the transitional Committee is spontenously dismissed. 

### Voting on CAS proposals

+ The CAS community website is the default channel for CAS participants to make proposals, exchange ideas, and cast votes. 

+ CAS coin holders can post any proposals or suggestions at the CAS website for community discussion. 

+ Other CAS coin holders can use their coins to cast “support” votes to these proposals. One coin one vote. 

+ When the support votes exceed 100,000 coins, then the proposal goes to CAS Joint Committee for discussion, and the Committee are obliged to present a Committee statement as a formal response to this proposal. 

+ If there are more than 100 million CAS coin that expresses "support", the proposal enters the public voting section of the whole network. Whole-network public voting is the most major thing of the CAS community. Its resolution is the highest resolution of CAS community. The technical development teams, the CAS Joint Committee and other community organizations must adhere to the results of CAS whole-network public voting. 

    - When one proposal gains the support of more than 100 million CAS coin, it automatically enters the whole-network public voting. 
	
    - The minimum period for publicity of whole-network public voting is 7 days; the maximum is no more than 30 days 
	
    - The whole-network public voting must gain the voting of 1 billion CAS coin before entering the voting section; the issue with less than 1 billion CAS coin is invalid. 
	
    - With more than 3/5 affirmative votes, the issue is passed and becomes the resolution of the entire community. 
	
    - If the contents of the proposal is to amend the system and operation mode of the CAS Joint Committee, it must gain the vote of at least 1.5 billion token and it can be passed with the 2/3 votes as the affirmative vote. 
	
+ The proposal passed by the whole-network vote automatically becomes the new CAS community law for the CAS Joint Committee to execute. 

## Appendix II: The Main Function of the CAS Community Website 

The CAS Joint Committee is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the future CAS community website. It is the platform for the participants of the CAS.Global ecology to issue information, exchange and make discussions. 

According to our preliminary conception, the CAS community website should contain the following sections: 

+ Tokenization section 

    - The tokenization white paper and its link issued through CAS smart contract
	
    - The newly issued tokenization subscription
	
    - The issued tokenization, the revelation of financial affairs, business and consumption conditions that the issuers voluntarily conduct, the price of token.
	
    - Each tokenization sets up a discussion area for the parties to discuss
	
+ Section of investors 

    - Help the investors connected to various resources in CAS ecology 
	
		- Tokenization research 
		
		- Exchange 
		
		- ETF, service of derivative products.
		
    - For the scoring of the invested tokenization and evaluation mechanism--it can be provided for other investors for reference after being integrated 
	
+ Section of proposal and whole-network vote

    - Announce the statement, the internal voting results of the committee, 
	
    - Election, including the candidate conditions, voting details, vote statistics. 

What are mentioned above are merely our conceptions. This community website will be an open system, where people can build new sections or add proposals the committee may increase the new section contents. The construction of CAS community requires our joint efforts. 

## Appendix III: An Open Letter to the Future CAS Joint Committee 

CAS Joint Committee：

Congratulations to the birth of the new committee and all the elected members! 

In the midsummer of 2017, the members of our initiating team wrote the bottom codes of CAS.Global on the computer and also racked the brains to make discussions as to how to avoid being trapped into the fate of the low-level ecology of the first two blockchains and restrict the powers of the members, prevent them turning from the spiritual leader of the CAS community to the public enemy of the community. 

You know that the CAS.Global is a totally self-consistent closed-hoop design, which is guaranteed by the low-level procedures and technical architecture. In the entire system design, the only element depending on "person" is the CAS Joint Committee. It will be difficult for blockchain ecology to get rid of the splitting fate if there is only procedure but not you; however, on the other hand, once we make the decision to set up a human organization in the procedure-dominant blockchain ecological architecture, the self-growth process of human organization will inevitably have the "centralization" tendency and may threaten the decentralization of CAS ecology and the ultimate objective of autonomy and self-government, thus finally making the joint committee lose credibility in the CAS ecology. 

With the expanding of ecology, the benefits in ecology will grow bigger and bigger, the chains will be longer and longer, and there will be more and more unprecedented appeals and disputes. And the CAS Joint Committee will master the major CAS coin resources and voting right. Where there is right and money, it may produce corruption. Although we have made various systems for prevention, formulating the three basic laws and a series of detailed rules of the committee system, whether the final operation effect of the committee becomes the constructive strength of CAS ecology or the destructive force cannot be decided by the procedures and machines, but by you, the human members produced through the whole-network public election. 

The future of CAS.Global ecology is in your hand. 

We believe that the credibility of the CAS Joint Committee in CAS ecology is the core premise of becoming the constructive strength for the system design of committee. Where does credibility come from? Where there is "justice", there is "trust"; with "trust", this committee can have "force" in the CAS ecology. The three basic laws of the CAS Joint Committee System can be summarized into one sentence: do not touch the power and money, avoid all the benefit conflicts with the parties of CAS ecology; all the matters are decided by the community. Members, as long as you master this dimension, the credibility of the committee in CAS ecology will be very strong. With the strong credibility, no one or organization can split the CAS community, for as long as the committee and the members stand there, the CAS ecology will be there. When this joint committee gains the support of the whole network, the CAS ecology and you will be integrated and cannot be separated. 

In 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto invented the first blockchain in the human history: Bitcoin His initial intention of design is to create a digital cryptocurrency system totally decided by the procedures, which can be influenced or controlled by no one. The birth of the blockchain contains the deep introspection and alert of Satoshi Nakamoto of human weaknesses. The initiating team of our CAS.Global also has the same vigilance of human weaknesses. However, we also believe that humanity also has its brightness, such as the sense of honor, sense of responsibility, justice and fairness, service community and dedication spirits. We are aware that humankind must face an unprecedented major philosophical subject in the future: facing the increasingly developed smart machines, how should the cooperation relationship be formed between men and machines to create a better future? The system design of the CAS Joint Committee will combine the blockchain totally decided by the procedures and the self-organization of humankind. In the philosophical sense, it is also an exploration and practice of this major subject of humankind in the future. Whether the final result of this exploration is delighting or upset will be decided by you in the committee as part of humankind. 

Finally, we want to end this letter with the words of the ancient sage Laozi in China: 

"Therefore, the sage treats all the things through the natural law of 'inaction' and alerts himself. He does not give lessons to others with the blank words. He has great achievements but are not proud, so he will never lose his feats." 

For mutual encouragement.
